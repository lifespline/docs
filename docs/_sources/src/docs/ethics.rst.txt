Philosophy
==========

Learn the conceptual framework below to format your understanding of the world.

* Reality :math:`\mathbf{R}` is anything that can be identified as something:
   * a tree
   * a person
   * a thought
   * a number
   * a concept
   * *etc.*
* :math:`\mathbf{B} \neq \emptyset` is the set of behaviours.
* A behaviour is a set of behaviours :math:`B_i \subset \mathbf{B}` (a set of behaviours can losely be denoted by behaviour as a linguistic abuse)
* A behaviour admits other names:
   * agent
   * event
   * *etc*
* A :math:`B_i` is that which persists through ``change``, or that which is said to **change**. ``change`` is equivalent with ``identity`` in that you only understand one concept through the other and vice-versa. Examples:
   * a person
   * a personality
   * the act of observing
   * the act of thinking
   * a tree
   * a concept
   * a thought
   * *etc.*
* A behaviour :math:`b` has a ``status`` :math:`\in \{` ``done`` :math:`\} \subset \{` ``potential`` :math:`\}`. The `status=done` is simply a label for the behaviours the agent perceives as **actual**, or what the agent perceives to be the **actual world**. An actual behaviour is also said to be indexed to a running interval in *time*, or what the agent denotes as `time=present`.
* A :math:`B_i` belongs to a class of complexity :math:`C_i`, *i.e.*, it has varying values of ``complexity``: :math:`B_i \in C_j`. A class of complexity defines the **amount** of ``work`` it requires to have :math:`B_i`'s status be changed to `status=done`. There is no SI unit for ``work``. It can be :math:`J`, :math:`s`, computational complexity, *etc.*
* Each :math:`B_i` has an ``engine`` :math:`E_i` such that :math:`E_i` is able to generate a certain amount of work, which requires that :math:`E_i` has the adequate:
    * resources :math:`S_i`
    * ``ethics``: conceptual understanding of reality
    * ``drive``

*  ``time`` is an abstraction over a binary change of behaviour ``status``, i.e., it is a ``sequence`` :math:`q` of ``status`` changes.
* ``physics`` are the ``sequence`` :math:`q` of ``status`` changes that the agent denotes as *natural laws* when the agent perceives the set of behaviours through the abstraction ot ``time``, *i.e.*, the agent recognizes that assigning a subset of :math:`q` in time always coincides with the same behaviour :math:`b` to be rendered ``actual``, what the agent denotes as **causality**. This means that ``time`` is an abstraction, but that conceptualizing behaviours from within this abstraction, enables the agent to change deterministically the ``status`` of some behaviours.
* resources :math:`S_i` include, for :math:`B_i` = :math:`B_0` = ``person``, or *that which behaves as a person*:
    * ``energy``
    * ``motivation``
    * ...

* A behaviour of interest is that of :math:`B_0` = ``person`` The ``drive`` of :math:`B_0` is keeping :math:`S_i` stable, which is understood by *the pursuit of happiness*

Affecting Behaviours: Agent Dynamics
====================================

By agent we mean any behaviour :math:`B_i`, but we also mean specifically :math:`B_0`. `agent dynamics` is the framework in which the agent perceives *its affection on its perceived behaviours*. The framework reduces the behaviours complexity by dividing the behaviour into different behaviours recursively of inferior complexity classes. When the refactoring behaviour is of complexity :math:`C_{0}`, the agent is able affect the necessary amount of work to change the behaviour's state to ``done`` (:math:`E_0 \in C_0`). These factored behaviours are also denoted by ``tasks``. Below, an example of an agent factoring behaviours until the behaviour is of complexity :math:`C_{0}`:

Taken separately, the actual ``work`` that the agent can affect/generate:

The units of work are distributed in function of :math:`S_i` in ``batches``:

`happiness` varies to a large extend as a function of the commitment to these units of work.

Complexity Reduction
====================

The process of complexity reduction is the process of understanding what the project consists of, and achieving precisely that.

+ Each ``node`` reduces the complexity of the AC of the parent ``node`` by virtue of making the AC more specific.
+ When the specification is sufficient so that the ``node`` can be exerted work upon by the agent, the ``node`` is a ``task``
+ the derivation of AC in between nodes is **semantic** (requires a human agent)
+ The complexity of a node is reduced to 0 by reducing the complexity of its AC to a specification sufficient so that the ``node`` can be exerted work upon by the agent, the ``node`` is a ``task``
+ a ``node`` reduces either to **more than one node** or to a **task**
+ a ``node`` can either be derived **in more than one** ``node`` or be transformed into a ``task``
+ a ``node network`` is in continuous transformation. Its transformation in time represents the **chain of complexity reduction operations** the development team performed on the root ``node``.
+ The complexity reduction process is not executed on iterations of a fixed duration. Instead, as soon as a **set of reduction branches has been completed** and the team has ``capacity`` to work on the branches, a ``batch`` or work is set in motion automatically.
+ Each ``node``'s AC contains an ``effort`` whose precision increases as the complexity reduces to a workable task. The ``effort`` precision is updated backwards analytically, and frontwards semantically (by the human agent performing the reduction)

Depending on the team's ``capacity``, a batch is automatically ``engaged``.

==========================================

The ``doc`` enables the agent to optimize ``focus`` by using ``git``.
